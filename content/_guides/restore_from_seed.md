If the wizard isn't already open, go to **File â†’ New/Restore**.

In the wizard, select **Restore wallet from seed**. Then, select your seed type.

Carefully type the seed into the textbox. Put a single space between each word. Double check that all words are entered in the correct order and spelled correctly.

Optionally, enter the seed offset passphrase. This is **not** the same as your wallet password or the wallet restore height. **If you are unsure what this is, leave it blank.**

On the next page, enter the [restore height](restore-height) or wallet creation date. Follow through the rest of the wizard like normal.

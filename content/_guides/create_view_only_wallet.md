A view-only wallet is a special type of wallet that can only see incoming transactions. If your wallet has outgoing transactions, the balance displayed will not be correct. To get a correct balance in a view-only wallet, you have to import the accompanying key images of each output of the wallet.

On the next page, enter the restore height or wallet creation date. Follow through the rest of the wizard like normal.

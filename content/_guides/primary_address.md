### What is the primary address?

A Monero wallet has one Primary address. On mainnet this address starts with a '4'.

The primary address is a valid Monero address and can be used to receive funds. (But we recommend that you don't, unless you have to!)

All subaddresses are derived from your primary address.

You may need your primary address when you are:

- [Solo-mining](mining-setup)
- [Creating a view-only wallet](create-view-only-wallet)
- Transacting with a service that does not accept subaddresses

If you are transaction with a service that does not accept addresses starting with an '8', please ask them to add support for subaddresses. This requires very little effort on their part.

### Why is the primary address hidden from the receive tab?

The primary address is hidden by default to discourage address re-use.

### Where can I find my primary address?

You can find it in **Wallet â†’ Keys**.

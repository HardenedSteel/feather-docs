If the wizard isn't already open, go to **File â†’ New/Restore**.

On the wizard, select **Create new wallet**.

On the next page, the wallet seed is shown. Unlike most Monero wallets, Feather uses 14 word seeds. To learn more about the seed scheme and the benefits compared to 25 word seeds, see the information [here](seed-scheme).

The seed allows you to recover your funds in case you lose access to your wallet files. DO NOT LOSE IT.

Click **next** after you have verified that the **you have written down all words in the correct order**.

In the **Name** field, type a name for your wallet. You may name the wallet whatever you want. Feather will automatically fill-in a name that hasn't already been used.

The **Directory** field shows the default location for the wallet files. We recommend leaving it as the default. If you want to store all files relative to the executable, follow the steps [here](portable-mode) to enable portable mode.

On the next page, choose a password to encrypt your wallet files with. It is recommended to use a strong password generated with a password manager, such as KeePassXC.

Click on **Create/Open wallet** to finish wallet creation.

To start Feather in portable mode: 

- Create a file named `.portable` or `portable.txt` in the same folder as the Feather program file. 

Feather will detect this file when it starts and enable portable mode.

In portable mode, Feather will write [wallet files](wallet-files), settings and other data to a folder named `feather_data` relative to the Feather program file.

Portable mode may be useful if you want to store Feather on:

- an external hard drive or USB drive
- an encrypted volume

**Note:** For Tails users: portable mode is enabled by default.

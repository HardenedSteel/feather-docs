Using **TailsOS?** See the instructions [here](tails) instead.

## AppImage

Download the latest AppImage for Linux from [featherwallet.org/download](https://featherwallet.org/download).

After the download is complete, **make sure to allow executing the file as a program**. You can often find this setting in the Properties â†’ Permissions tab in your file explorer. Alternatively, run `chmod +x feather-x.x.x.AppImage` in a terminal.

You should now be able to run the AppImage by double clicking on the file in a file explorer. If that does not work, try right clicking on the file, and look for "Run" or "Open". Alternatively, you can start Feather by typing `./feather-x.x.x.AppImage` in a terminal.

Having trouble getting Feather to start? Please [contact](report-an-issue) the developers.

### Goals

- Provide an easy-to-use, small and fast graphical wallet that runs well on any modern hardware.
- Be beginner friendly, but also cater to advanced Monero users by providing a feature set that is on par with the official CLI.
- Serve as a testing grounds for experimental features that may later be adopted in the reference wallets.
- Ship with sane defaults that suit most users, but allow it to be configured for high or uncommon threat models as well.

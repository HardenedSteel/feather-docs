Go to **Wallet â†’ Seed** or press the seed icon in the status bar. Enter your password to open the dialog.

The seed is not available on view-only wallets or wallets that are backed by a hardware device.

Feather will show a 14 word seed for wallets that were created using Feather.

You can convert a 14 word seed into a 25 word seed by checking "**Show 25 word seed**". This may come in handy if you want to restore your wallet using software that does not support 14 word seeds. Make sure to also take note of your restore height if you're planning to restore your wallet from the 25 word seed.

To learn more about 14 word seeds, see [Seed scheme](seed-scheme).

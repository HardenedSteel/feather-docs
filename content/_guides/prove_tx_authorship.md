**Note:** Transaction authorship does not prove you paid a certain amount to a certain address. For that, see [prove payment](prove-payment).

Go to the **History** tab. Right click on the transaction you want to prove authorship of **â†’ Create tx proof**. Select "Prove authorship of a transaction (SpendProof)".

You may enter an optional message in the **Message** textbox to be included in the proof.

To export your proof as a PGP-like message, click **Get Formatted Proof**. Note that only Feather Wallet currently supports this format.

To get the proof signature manually, click **Get Signature**.

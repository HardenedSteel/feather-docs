The Import Transaction tool can be used to manually import a missing transaction. Before using this tool make sure your wallet is [synchronized](synchronization).

Go to **Tools â†’ Import Transaction**. Enter the transaction ID, and click **Load**. Then click **Import**.

If the transaction belongs to the wallet it should now show up in the **History** tab. If the import succeeded, but you can't find the transaction make sure you have the correct [account](accounts) selected.
